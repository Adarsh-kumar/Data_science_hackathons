# Data_science_hackathons

Repository of some of the data science hackathons i have participated. ZS_data_science challenge contains my submissions for Zs contest at hackereath.
I have Two different models (Weekly time series and xgboost). Time series based models are better for finding short term correlation but since the 
dataset was quiet diverse in feature of dates xgboost based model was better performing.
