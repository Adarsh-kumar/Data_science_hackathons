The problem was to predict the shipping status of the courier services. The data set have 12 features which includes the date of compalaint-registered , complaint-reason ,coustemer's comment, response provided by the company etc.

First of all the data set is heighly unbalanced in terms of different classes of the status.Here's the distribution  of differnt classes-

class -1    34300
class 3-     5018
class 2-     2818
class 0-     809
class 4-     321

Due to heighly unbalaced class distribution simple ensemble technique results in a low f1 score of 0.65.

strategy -

I tried to build a hirerchical classification type of model such that first it will classify into class 1 or rest of all classes combined.
Similaly for the next step it will either class 3 or rest of the classes combined and finally each point will be assigned a single class.
Building a boosting model for each step resulted in a f1 score of 0.715 ( around 6 % percent better).

further improvement-

During testing this model on cross validation set , I observed that model at the third step is classifying all the points in a sinle class.
I plotted the bivarite plots of the given features ( as shown in the notebook) that although the classes are not very heighly imbalanced but the distibution of the some of the features is creating ambibuity for the model, I dropped those features and also applied undersampling(looking at the bivaiate plots some of the majority class points were too close so I decided to perform the undersampling ), which improved the f1 score to 0.72091 arond 1 % improvemnt (arond 140 points were now classified in the right class).


One more observation was that most of the points that should be in class 3 has been classified in class 2 ,so i planned to built a model to classify the points in either 1 or 2&3 combined or 0&4 combined and then another classifier for class 2 and class3.
It improved the model accuracy by 1.4 % percent and the best f1 score was 0.7341.
